  "introduction": "Huatao is a postdoctoral researcher at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. <a href=\"https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/\">Mo Li</a>. He obtained Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, supervised by Prof. <a href=\"https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/\">Mo Li</a> and co-supervised by Prof. <a href=\"https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/\">Rui Tan</a>.\n                                Before that, he received B.S. degree from Nanjing University and Master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n                                <br>\n                                <br>\n                                He is broadly interested in ubiquitous computing, especially in related fields of building wearable-based or wireless-based sensing interfaces to bridge gaps between computing resources and human's daily lives. His current research focuses on wearable-based sensing, including human activity recognition, localization, authentication, etc.\n                                <br>",
